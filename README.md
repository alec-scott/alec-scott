- 👋 Hi, I’m @alec-scott
- 👀 I’m interested in renewable energy, trading bots and stumbling my way through code.
- 🌱 I’m currently a University Engineering Student (@UNSW)... currently learning everything coding, I am a complete novice!
- :crayon: I'm currently writing a thesis on Autonomus Solar Plant Inspections. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything!
